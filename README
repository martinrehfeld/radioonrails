Radio is a intranet based recorder for audio streams. It has been developed
for demonstration purposes of the Ruby on Rails framework.

To get started you will have to create at least a development database and
enter its connection information in config/database.yml

Then issue

   rake migrate

to create the schema and

   rake backgroundrb:start

to activate the scheduling.

Start your local development web server

   script/server

and point your browser to

   http://localhost:3000/                OR
   http://localhost:3000/recordings      (for the main GUI)
   http://localhost:3000/recordings.rss  (to get a Podcast RSS feed)
   http://localhost:3000/stations        (to administer radio stations)
